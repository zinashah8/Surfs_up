# Hawaii Surfing Weather Analysis 

### Overview:
The purpose of this project was to analyze the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, HI to evaluate the year-round plausibility and sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop. 


## Technology Used:
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* SQLite
* SQLAlchemy 

## Data Sources:

* June temperatures range between 64 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit and December temperatures range between 56 and 83 degrees Fahrenheit.
* 50% of June and December temperatures are above 75 and 71 degrees, respectively. 
* The average temperature in June is 75 and in December it is 71.
* Temperatures in December have a wider range than those recorded in June as indicated by the higher standard deviation in December. 


## Summary and Conclusions:

The temperatures in December are slightly lower in than June, but conditions appear to be suitable for a surf and ice cream shop business in both months.

Per a further analysis, rainfall is higher in June than in December, so that discrepancy might off-set the lower temperature in December.
